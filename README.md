#### Data-Mining-OULAD   

Open University Learning Analytics Dataset contains data about courses, students and their interactions with the Virtual Learning Environment for seven selected courses. Our aim is to deliver an understanding of the behavior of students at risk of failure, contributing to the decision-making policies using classification, clustering and regression algorithms, to devise suitable interventions to help students succeed.   

Please refer the report of the performed analysis.
